## Goals
- We are addressing the challenges in young voter turnout. Democracy needs the votes of every person and one factor is the amount of time it takes to understand views. 

## External
- Representatives, Senators, Mayors, Sheriffs, City Council
- Able to write legislation
- Direct Communication and “LinkedIn” for politicians
- CEO’s Views
- City Council Member's Views 
- Mayor Views 
- State Representatives Views 
- All Sides for news 
- AI request to speak to a spokesperson/representative
- Are there any parties or people outside of the company who need to be involved in this business process? Their input might be key for you to decide aspects of the process. Those people should be referenced here.

## OVERVIEW
- We want to help younger people understand political beliefs and support. In national, state, and local elections, our goal is to work with candidates to better connect with young voters. By presenting information from an unbiased perspective and using resources and news that fairly represent each candidate, we provide a platform where all current and aspiring representatives can be viewed together.

## PURPOSE
- With younger voter turnout fluctuating, it is important to gain younger voters when considering elections. Equipping younger voters with information on candidates and how their election may impact the voter in the future. 

## SCOPE
- 18-29 year old voters are becoming increasingly lazy in researching politics. We want there to be a space where young adults can be informed in an unbiased view of politics and world events that are impacting the nation.
